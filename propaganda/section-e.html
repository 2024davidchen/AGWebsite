    <h1>Section E</h1>
    <p>Section E is mainly focused on choosing examples to strengthen the speaker's arguement</p>

    </ol>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T1">Concurrency
            <p>The speaker states that because one thing happened during something else, one must have caused the other</p>
            <p>Simplified: Because A happened during B, B must have caused A</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Biden was president when all the gas prices went up. It must be his fault that gas is so expensive.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T2">Post Hoc
            <p>The speaker states because one thing happened after another, one must have caused the other</p>
            <P>Simplified: Because A happened after B, B must have caused A</P>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Ever since Tara helped me get that hamster at the arcade, I've been getting a lot of kills in Overwatch. We should go to the arcade again and get something else so that I can do even better.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T3">Selected Instances
            <p>The speaker chooses a few niche (rare) cases and uses them as if all cases are like this</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">I don't need to study Prop. David and Andrew didn't study and they did terrific.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T4">Hasty Generalization
            <p>The speaker sees one thing happen and assumes that the future will be similar</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Coach David tried to teach us Ling last week, but I didn't understand a thing. He must not be a very good coach.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T5">Faulty Analogy
            <p>The speaker knows that two things are similar in one way, so they assume they are in another</p>
            <p>Simplified: Because A and B are similar in one way, they must be in another</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example"></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T6">Composition
            <p>These things are good individually, therefore they are good together</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mr. Torgue: "I probably shoulda set you up with a sponsor beforehand but I was busy suplexing a shark wearing a bolo tie when I should have been setting up sponsors." (Quote taken from Borderlands 2)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T7">Division
            <p>This group is good, so if I take a part of it it must be good too</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mother to son: "I know you have a math test tomorrow, but I don't want to see you staying up too late."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T8">Non Sequitor
            <p>The technique being used is not in this range. Scroll down for High School</p>
            <p>Note: This means it is not 0 No Technique, make sure to look if there is actually propaganda (like if they are actually trying to persuade you of something)</p>
            <p>Usually you shouldn't think too hard about it, if it is a technique from another section they will usually make it very blatantly obvious</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">I don't understand why you don't like August. He's an angel; he doesn't swear and he's always really wholesome. (B2 Metaphor and Simile)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>HIGH SCHOOL ONLY:</b> Non Sequitor instead means that the speaker uses logic incorrectly. If they are using the logic correctly, it is 0 No Technique</p>
            <p>Note: You have to actually use the logic and see if it applies, even if it isn't right if you think about it enough. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Law of Detachment:
                    <p>If A happens then B happens. A happened. Therefore, B happened.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Law of Contrapositive:
                    <p>If A happens then B happens. B did not happen. Therefore, A did not happen.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Disjunctive Syllogism:
                    <p>Only A or B can happen. A didn't happen. Therefore B happened (Or if B didn't happen, A happened)</p>
                </li>
                <li>Hypothetical Syllogism:
                    <p>A leads to B. B leads to C. Therefore, A leads to C</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mrs. Dean told us we'd do well on the test if we studied. Andy got an A+, so he must have studied. (8 Non Sequitor)</li>
                <li class="example">Mrs. Dean said I'll do well on the AP Exam if I studied. I studied last night, therefore I should do well. (0 No Technique)</li>
                <li class="example">August said he'd rank up to Silver 1 if he won that game yesterday. He got to Silver 1 so he must have won that game. (8 Non Sequitor)</li>
                <li class="example">Yuxuan said she'd finish my Amazon order if I did well on the practice ACT I did last night. She didn't finish my order so I must not have done well. (0 No Technique)</li>
                <li class="example">Mason said he'd either do well in Prop or Theme. He got 1st place in Theme, so he must not have done well in Prop. (8 Non Sequitor)</li>
                <li class="example">August said he'd either be asleep or talking on Discord when he woke up. He isn't online in Discord so he must still be asleep. (0 No Technique)</li>
                <li class="example">If I have extra time tonight I can study for the math test tomorrow. If I study for the math test tomorrow I'll do well. I don't have any extra time tonight so I won't do well on the test. (8 Non Sequitor)</li>
                <li class="example">If I get a job, I'll start making money. If I make money, I can buy whatever I want. I need to get a job to buy whatever I want. (0 No Technique)</li>
