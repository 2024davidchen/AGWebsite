    <h1>Section E</h1>
    <p>Section E is mainly focused on choosing examples to strengthen the speaker's arguement</p>
    <h2>Techniques:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#T1">Concurrency</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T2">Post Hoc</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T3">Selected Instances</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T4">Hasty Generalization</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T5">Faulty Analogy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T6">Division</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T7">Composition</a></li>
        <li><a href="#T8">Non Sequitor</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T1">Concurrency
            <p>The speaker states that because one thing happened during something else, one must have caused the other</p>
            <p>Simplified: Because A happened during B, B must have caused A</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Biden was president when all the gas prices went up. It must be his fault that gas is so expensive.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T2">Post Hoc
            <p>The speaker states because one thing happened after another, one must have caused the other</p>
            <P>Simplified: Because A happened after B, B must have caused A</P>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Ever since Tara helped me get that hamster at the arcade, I've been getting a lot of kills in Overwatch. We should go to the arcade again and get something else so that I can do even better.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T3">Selected Instances
            <p>The speaker chooses a few niche (rare) cases and uses them as if all cases are like this</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">I don't need to study Prop. David and Andrew didn't study and they did terrific.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T4">Hasty Generalization
            <p>The speaker sees one thing happen and assumes that the future will be similar</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Coach David tried to teach us Ling last week, but I didn't understand a thing. He must not be a very good coach.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T5">Faulty Analogy
            <p>The speaker knows that two things are similar in one way, so they assume they are in another</p>
            <p>Simplified: Because A and B are similar in one way, they must be in another</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example"></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T6">Vagueness
            <p>The speaker makes something vague that isn't very specific, which brings multiple possible answers</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mother to son: "I know you have a math test tomorrow, but I don't want to see you staying up too late."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T7">Ambiguity
            <p>The speaker words things things in a way that has 2 different meanings, even if it is clear that only one of the meanings makes sense</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mr. Torgue: "I probably shoulda set you up with a sponsor beforehand but I was busy suplexing a shark wearing a bolo tie when I should have been setting up sponsors." (Quote taken from Borderlands 2)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T8">Shift of Meaning
            <p>The speaker uses a word multiple times but uses a different definition/meaning of it each time</p>
            <p>Homonyms (words that sound the same) are also considered Shift of Meaning</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Everybody makes mistakes. But you drive yourself to be better. That's why you should drive a Honda today.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
