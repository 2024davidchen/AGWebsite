    <h1>Section C</h1>
    <p>Section C is mainly focused on adding random things that make the speaker's arguement seem better but are actually kind of irrelevant</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For this section especially, make sure to watch out for No Techniques. The technique only applies if the details given are <strong>irrelevant</strong>. If the details are actually <strong>relevant (they make sense in the context)</strong> then it is most likely No Technique</p>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Look at the way Melissa is dressed for her interview. Clearly she fits our qualifications for a software developer. (1 Appearance)</li>
                <li class="example">Look at the way Melissa is dressed. We should hire her as a model. (0 No Technique)</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Techniques:</h2>

    </ol>
    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T1">Appearance
            <p>The speaker notes the appearance to strengthen their arguement</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example"></li>
            
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T2">Metaphor and Simile
            <p>The speaker compares/describes something symbolically, not literally. A metaphor is worded in a way that makes it seem almost literally, while simile is worded using "like" or "as"</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Coach to kids: "Kids, please pay attention. I know learning Ling is hard, but it is a mountain you have to overcome." (Metaphor)</li>
                <li class="example">Don't invite George into our friend group, he's like a rat; small, hard to deal with, and he'll bite you the first change he gets." (Simile)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T3">Emphasis
            <p>The speaker emphasizes what somebody else has said in a way that takes it a bit too literally or exact to change the meaning</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Ian's mother is furious after he didn't wash the dishes when she told him to last night 
                    <p>Mother: "I told you I wanted you to wash the dishes last night"</p>
                    <p>Son: "You said you wanted me to, not that I had to"</p>
                </li>
                <li class="example">A man gets pulled over for drinking and driving
                    <p>Man: "But officer, I wasn't drinking while I was driving. Therefore, I was only driving.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T4">Quotation Out of Context
            <p>The speaker quotes something but cuts it out in a way that changes the meaning to their use</p>
            <p>NOTE FOR HIGH SCHOOL ONLY: You are expected to know a few famous quotes/sayings, and if the speaker modifies them for their own use, it is still considered Quotation Out of Context</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Sammy: "You could say our project was a success, if you ignore everything that went wrong." 
                    <p>Allan: "Sammy said their project was a success."</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T5">Abstract Terms
            <p>The speaker uses a word or phrase but doesn't exactly know what it means. Usually the speaker will either try to avoid giving an actual definition when asked to or gives a definition that doesn't really mean anything</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">David: "I wish games today were a bit more old-school"
                    <p>August: "What do you mean by that?"</p>
                    <p>David: "C'mon August, you should know what I mean by old-school"</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T6">Vagueness
            <p>The speaker makes something vague that isn't very specific, which brings multiple possible answers</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mother to son: "I know you have a math test tomorrow, but I don't want to see you staying up too late."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T7">Ambiguity
            <p>The speaker words things things in a way that has 2 different meanings, even if it is clear that only one of the meanings makes sense</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mr. Torgue: "I probably shoulda set you up with a sponsor beforehand but I was busy suplexing a shark wearing a bolo tie when I should have been setting up sponsors." (Quote taken from Borderlands 2)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T8">Shift of Meaning
            <p>The speaker uses a word multiple times but uses a different definition/meaning of it each time</p>
            <p>Homonyms (words that sound the same) are also considered Shift of Meaning</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Everybody makes mistakes. But you drive yourself to be better. That's why you should drive a Honda today.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T9">Sophistical Formula
            <p>The speaker uses a word multiple times but uses a different definition/meaning of it each time</p>
            <p>Homonyms (words that sound the same) are also considered Shift of Meaning</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Everybody makes mistakes. But you drive yourself to be better. That's why you should drive a Honda today.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
