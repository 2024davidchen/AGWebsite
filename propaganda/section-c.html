    <h1>Section C</h1>
    <p>Section C is mainly focused on adding random things that make the speaker's arguement seem better but are actually kind of irrelevant</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> For this section especially, make sure to watch out for No Techniques. The technique only applies if the details given are <strong>irrelevant</strong>. If the details are actually <strong>relevant (they make sense in the context)</strong> then it is most likely No Technique</p>
    <p>Most of these techniques can also be used either positively or negatively</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="example">I heard former President Obama went to Zingerman's. That must be a really great resturaunt. (3 Degrees and Titles)</li>

        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T9">Sophistical Formula

                <li class="example">I don't understand why you don't put any work into AG. Even if you did well during the Saturday Tournaments, that doesn't guarentee that you'll do well at States.
