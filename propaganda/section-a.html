    <h2>Definitions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T1">Prejudice
            <p>Think of prejudice as "pre-judging" something. This means that the speaker unfairly judging without knowing enough information or context</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Everybody knows Asians are good at math. Angela's Asian so she must be able to help us study for our math test tomorrow.</li>
            
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T2">Academic Detachment
            <p>Academic Detachment is where the speaker is given a decision but refuses to make one</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">The PS5 looks cool, but I like Xbox controllers better. I guess I won't buy either console.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T3">Drawing the Line
            <p>The speaker is given only two choices when in reality, there are more possibilities</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">Mother to son: "It's 11 PM right now, you can either go study for your math test tomorrow or go to sleep"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T4">Not Drawing the Line
            <p>The speaker does not set a limit where one should be made</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="example">I've already eaten 6 slices of pizza, I might as well finish the rest.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T5">Conservatism, Radicalism, Moderatism
            <p>This technique is a combination of three concepts, if you see any of these, just select 5 and it will be considered correct</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conservatism
                    <p>Old is good (think about conserving something)</p>
                </li>
                <li>Radicalism
                    <p>New is good</p>
                </li>
                <li>Moderatism
                    <p>Compromise is good</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T6">Rationalization
            <p>Making Excuses</p>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T7">Wishful Thinking
            <p>Because the speaker wants it to be true, they think it will happen</p>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T8">Tabloid Thinking
            <p>The speaker bases their thoughts on common stereotypes</p>
            <p>Very similar to prejudice, the main difference is that tabloid thinking does not have an action associated with it</p>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T9">Causal Oversimplification
            <p>The speaker narrows the cause of a complex topic to only one or two reasons instead of the full piccture</p>
        </li>
        <li class="technique-title" id="T10">Inconceivability
            <p>The speaker says something isn't true because they can't believe it's true (conceive means to understand or believe, inconceivability literally means you can't believe it)</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
